# Grep::Query 1.002

This module implements a limited query language for logical expressions
(AND, OR, NOT, parenthesized, ...etc) and apply it to lists of data for
selecting a subset, similar to using "grep" with a block/regexp in the code.

A reason for not using grep with a regular code block directly is that the
original impetus for its existence was to allow a user running a command-line
tool to submit an arbitrary query for a list the tool had somehow generated
(e.g. a list of file names).

The initial approach of having the user pass individual regexes for doing
"include/exclude" operations proved to be too limiting if the selection
criteria became more complex. Hence the notion of a query language that
makes it possible to express more complex combinations of regexes was born.  

Matching can be most readily done on plain lists of scalar strings/values,
but by providing a 'field accessor', matching can be done against lists of
arbitrary objects/hashes using all possible data they contain, including
doing both string (regexes, eq/ne/gt/ge/lt/le) as well as numerical
(==/!=/>/>=/</<=) comparisons.

Arguably, it may be seen as a 'grep' on steroids :-).
