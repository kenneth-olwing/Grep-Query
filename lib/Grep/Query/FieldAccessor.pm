=head1 NAME

Grep::Query::FieldAccessor - Helper object to hold methods to access fields in the supplied hashes/objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Grep::Query::FieldAccessor;

  # fill up an object with accessors
  #
  my $fieldAccessor1 = Grep::Query::FieldAccessor->new();
  $fieldAccessor1->add('name', sub { $_[0]->getName() });
  $fieldAccessor1->add('age', sub { $_[0]->calculateAge() });
  ...
  
  # equal, but provide it all in one go
  #
  my $fieldAccessor2 = Grep::Query::FieldAccessor->new
      (
          {
              name => sub { $_[0]->getName() },
              age => sub { $_[0]->calculateAge() },
              ...
          }
      );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When using a L<Grep::Query> holding a query denoting fields, an object of this
type must be passed along.

It must contain methods, indexed on field names, that given an item in the
queried list, can extract the value to compare with.

B<Beware:> Ensure the methods supplied don't cause side-effects when they are
called (such as causing the object or other things to change). 

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new( [ $hash ] )

Creates a new field accessor object.

If the optional C<$hash> is provided, fields will be populated from it,
otherwise the L</add> method must be used.

=head2 add( $fieldname, $sub )

Adds an accessor for the given field.

Croaks if the params don't seem to be what they should be or if a field is
added more than once.

=head2 access( $fieldname, $obj )

(normally used by the internal query execution)

Looks up the code sub for the given field and executes it with obj as a
parameter and returns the result. 

=head2 assertField

(normally used by the internal query execution)

Retrieves the code sub for the given field.

Croaks if no such field is defined.
